## Problem Statement
As a solution to this assignment, you are supposed to create the replica of following
Bootstrap components using Css(flexbox for layout) and Jquery only. You are not
allowed to use bootstrap files. Here is the list of components that you are supposed
to create -
1. Collapse component - accordion format
2. Navbar component
3. Modal component

In your submission, you should create separate HTML, CSS and JS files for each of the
components. You may create the most basic version of these components. The
components must be fully responsive. You are supposed to use flexboxes for
responsiveness. So, when your HTML file is opened, it would contain one the
components, For example - The Navbar and it should show the behaviour exactly same
as Original Bootstrap navbar. But your code must not use bootstrap to create it. You are
supposed to write it from Scratch.

### Here are some important points -
1) You are free to change the colors, font, icon etc. Extra points will be given for
creativity.
2) You must not use Bootstrap files to create them and you must not copy it from
somewhere.
3) Your components must be fully responsive.
